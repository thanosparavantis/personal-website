  "description": "Hamop (from ham radio operator) is an advanced social networking application created as a hobby project of mine. It uses Google's Firebase for the backend and the React framework for the frontend. The styling is based on Tailwind CSS utility-first framework. Visitors are able to sign up using their Google account and create a public profile to interact with others on the website. Registered users can make posts, comments, like other people's posts and earn reputation on their profile. The frontend was hosted on Netlify, so no custom servers were needed. Using free and open source tools, there is no essential cost for the project to be alive.",

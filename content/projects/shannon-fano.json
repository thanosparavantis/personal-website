  "description": "A Python project that was developed as a university assignment for the subject of Code and Information Theory. The program features a client-server implementation using sockets. It simulates a simple exchange of an image between the client and the server. Once the user inputs a specific parameter on how the image should be compressed, the Shannon-Fano coding is applied. The image is compressed and sent from the client to the server, which then applies decompression to reconstruct the image.",

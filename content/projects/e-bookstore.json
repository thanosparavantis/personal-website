  "description": "A C# application that was developed as a university assignment for the subject of Human Interaction with Computers. The app includes sign in and registration features for employees and customers. We setup a virtual coffee shop interface with the ability to order items from a menu. We further include a virtual photocopy machine interface with several photocopying options to choose from. We also implement a complete online bookstore with book overviews and shopping cart features. This software was developed in phases based on RUP with detailed UML diagrams.",

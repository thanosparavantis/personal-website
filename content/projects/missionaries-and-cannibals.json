  "description": "A Java solution to the Missionaries and Cannibals problem developed as a university assignment for the subject of Artificial Intelligence and Experienced Systems. We start off with the traditional setup of three missionaries and three cannibals, tasked with crossing a river using a boat. The boat may carry at most two entities, independent of their type. The solution is given by first modeling all of the different states and then applying the Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithm on the state space. While the search is active, all states are printed on the console.",

  "description": "A simple Tic-Tac-Toe game implementation in C# using window based components. The user is greeted with the game setup form to select the blue or red player. Then, the game starts off in a five by five grid of clickable elements, similar to the traditional Tic-Tac-Toe setup. The user is tasked to beat a naive computer player that is configured to make random moves by selecting empty spots on the game board. As the game progresses, we check whether our win conditions are satisfied by checking diagonal left, diagonal right, horizontally and vertically. Depending on each player's moves, the game can end in a win or draw state.",

  "description": "This web application was my first full fledged social network I created in PHP using the Laravel framework. Inspired by features found on Facebook and Twitter, it includes an authentication system, user profiles, topic based post creation with comments and user ratings. Users are able to search for content and receive notifications when others interact with their content. A custom administrative support system is also included, with a functioning report system, knowledge base and account restrictions.",

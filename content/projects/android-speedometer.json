  "description": "A simple Android application that was developed for the subject of Software Engineering. The app uses Google's services to determine the phone's location and creates a local database to keep track of speeding violations. The user is able to set the upper speed limit (km/h) and start or pause speed monitoring on demand. When a speeding violation is detected, the app notifies the user with characteristic sounds and text-to-speech messages. The longitude, latitude, speed and timestamp of the violations are stored locally and overlaid on a Google Map.",
